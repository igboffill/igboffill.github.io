            <p> Leonard Norman Cohen (September 21, 1934 â€“ November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and
                novelist. His work explored religion, politics, isolation, depression, sexuality, loss, death, and
                romantic relationships.[1] He was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian
                Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was invested as a Companion of the
                Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, he received one of the Prince of
                Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.
            </p>
            <p>Cohen pursued a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s, and did not begin a music
                career until 1967. His first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967), was followed by three more albums of
                folk music: Songs from a Room (1969), Songs of Love and Hate (1971) and New Skin for the Old Ceremony
                (1974). His 1977 record Death of a Ladies' Man, co-written and produced by Phil Spector, was a move away
                from Cohen's previous minimalist sound.
            </p>
            <p>In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional Recent Songs, which blended his acoustic style with
                jazz, East Asian, and Mediterranean influences. Cohen's most famous song, "Hallelujah", was released on
                his seventh album, Various Positions (1984). I'm Your Man in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized
                productions. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, The Future, which had dark lyrics and references to
                political and social unrest.
            </p>
            <p>Cohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of Ten New Songs, a major hit in Canada and Europe. His
                eleventh album, Dear Heather, followed in 2004. In 2005, Cohen discovered that his manager had stolen
                most of his money and sold his publishing rights, prompting a return to touring to recoup his losses.
                Following a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2013, he released three albums in the final
                years of his life: Old Ideas (2012), Popular Problems (2014), and You Want It Darker (2016), the last of
                which was released three weeks before his death. His posthumous, fifteenth, and final studio album
                Thanks for the Dance, was released in November 2019.
            </p>
            <p>Rolling Stone ranked him number 103 in their 200 Greatest Singers of all time, in 2023.</p>
